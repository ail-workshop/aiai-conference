				The talk of "artificial intelligence" is everywhere.
				From its use in medical diagnosis to relationship chatbots, AI technology is improving rapidly in the diverse tasks it can perform, offering genuine benefits to human social life along with novel risks.
				With so much at stake, AI designers and users would be wise to have a sober conversation about what AI systems are.
				In addition to technical knowledge of AI systems, such a conversation also requires a strong theoretical understanding of AI systems as unique agents that encode, or can be interpreted as encoding, intentional actions in communication with humans.
				In particular, large language models (LLMs) are often used by humans in unique forms of request-making, collaboration, and problem solving.
				As a result, humans find themselves working with and alongside LLM systems when carrying out a range of tasks in research, industry, art, and more.
				It is the goal of this proposed conference, "Agency and Intentions in Artificial Intelligence," to promote a much-needed interdisciplinary conversation surrounding the theoretical basis of AI systems as agent-like collaborators.  
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
				We plan to bring together philosophers, linguists, cognitive scientists, and computer scientists in a rich and multi-faceted discussion regarding questions of agency and intentions in AI and LLMs.
				The proposed workshop is interdisciplinary in nature, since AI systems are themselves the products of multiple disciplines.
				Rather than view the complexity of AI as a challenge to productive conversation, we think of it as an opportunity to bring thinkers from diverse backgrounds together to share various tools, methods, theories, and perspectives on how to make sense of agency in non-human computational systems.
				We do not expect all of the presenters at the workshop to share the same methodological assumptions or research backgrounds, nor do we expect such congruence in our attendees.
				This allows all participants to benefit from seeing questions of agency and AI from new standpoints.
				Additionally, it encourages speakers and attendees to present their ideas and questions in clear and accessible ways so that, say, a linguist can effectively communicate their work to philosophers and cognitive scientists.
